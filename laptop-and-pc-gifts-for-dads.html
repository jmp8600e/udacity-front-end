            </div>
            
            <p>With a clean design and a combination of 1,050-denier ballistic nylon and leather accents, the Bolt is an office-friendly adult backpack. It's got magnetic enclosures on some pockets, room for a 15-inch laptop and space for your umbrella.</p>

            <p>A great tool for reading on the train or taking notes in a meeting, the iPad Mini surprised everyone with a big refresh for 2019. Besides a new A12 processor, it also adds Apple Pencil support, so it'll work with Apple's excellent stylus. There's also a new bigger-screen iPad Air, but the current 9.7-inch plain old iPad is a great deal you can usually find on sale for $250.</p>

            <h2>Dell XPS 13, $950 and up</h2>
            
            <div class="article-images">

            </div>
            
            <p>The Dell XPS has long-been a go-to for anyone looking for a 13-inch, non-Apple laptop. The latest version fixes the irritating webcam placement, offers both 1080p and 4K touch screens, and comes in a couple of cool colors. Even with new CPU updates, it still starts at $899, which is impressive, considering the design. But, if you're giving one as a gift, at least jump up $100 to the Core i5 CPU option.</p>

            <h2>Apple MacBook Air, $1,099 and up</h2>

            </div>
            
            <p>There's a reason this is one of the most popular computers ever made. And now it's gotten a much-needed reboot, keeping the name but changing just about everything else, both outside and in. With a slimmer body, better screen and new CPUs, this should be the default choice for a dad who needs a little bit of everything in his laptop. One caveat: Not everyone loves the new keyboard design.</p>

            <h2>HP Spectre Folio, $895</h2>

            </div>
            
            <p>Rather than just bolting a leather panel onto the back of a laptop lid, HP has crafted a truly premium product, where a magnesium frame is paired with a leather outer shell that covers just about everything except for the keyboard and screen. With a central hinge, the screen flips back to form a tablet and a stylus sits in a leather loop hanging off the side.</p>
