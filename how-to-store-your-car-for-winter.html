            <h6><b>SHORT BIO</b>:  Brian Cooley checks the tech and always tells it like it is. His favorite car? Anything that nails what it set out to do, which may make him the only auto journalist who gets as excited by an Optima as a Hurac√°n. He's been focused on high-tech cars and modern driving since he did CNET's first car review in 2005.</h6>
            
            <p>Need to store your car for the winter, a school year or a deployment? Here's how to do a good job of it without standing on your head or disassembling your car. </p>
            
           <div class="article-images">
                <img src="img/HowToStoreYourCar1.JPG" alt="How to store your car">                
                <figcaption>Everyone thinks of a car cover when it comes to storing a car. That's just the beginning.</figcaption>
            </div>               
            
            <h2>Store vs. park</h2>
            
            <p>There is no bright line between lengthy parking and long-term storage, but as a rule of thumb take the storage steps below if you plan to leave your car for more than three weeks to nine months. Shorter than that and you can probably just park it; longer than that and there are additional, more difficult steps that we won't cover here.</p>
            
            <h2>Location</h2>
            
            <p>Store your car in as dry a place as possible, preferably in a garage on a concrete floor. Climate controlled storage is nice, but not necessary -- your car wasn't designed to be parked in a living room. On other hand, carports and dirt spaces aren't great as they allow too much moisture, UV and grime to attack the car while it sits.</p>
            
            <div class="article-images">
                <img src="img/HowToStoreYourCar2.JPG" alt="How to store your car">                
                <figcaption>Wherever you store your car, a solid surface that separates it from moist ground is a major plus.</figcaption>
            </div>  
            
            <h2>Fuel stabilization</h2>
            
            <p>Add enough fuel stabilizer to treat a full tank and do so at a gas station so you can fill the tank at the same time. That removes the most oxygen from the tank while also swirling the gasoline and fuel treatment. The drive home should be sufficient to feed that treated mixture through your car's entire fuel system.</p>

            <h2>Sta-Bil Concentrated Fuel Stabilizer</h2>
            
            <div class="article-images">

                <figcaption>A well-known gasoline treatment for storage</figcaption>
            </div>  
            
            <p>Sta-Bil is a solid example of treatments for gasoline that allow it to sit for long periods without degradation.</p>

            <h2>Fresh oil</h2>
            
            <p>If you haven't just changed your oil, do so before storage. That removes much of the dirty oil that contains corrosive byproducts of combustion, and you have the added bonus of not needing an oil change when you get your car out of storage later.</p> 


            <h2>Battery preservation</h2>
            
            <p>There are several ways to go here, but the end result is the same: avoiding the drag of a dead battery when you get your car out of storage. You can attach a plug-in battery tender that monitors battery level and trickle-charges it when needed. These are smaller than the typical full-size battery charger used to quickly resuscitate a dead battery</p>
            
            <h2>Battery Tender 12V Battery Charger</h2>
            
            <p>A small battery tender like this will not only keep your battery charged, it will also make sure it doesn't lose its settings, unlike disconnection methods that are OK for older cars.</p>

            <p>I prefer to disconnect the battery with a quick disconnect adapter that mounts on the negative battery post. I find it works really well, costs very little and carries no risk of fire from any kind of charger. The downside is that you will lose all your settings like radio presets and clock time, so this is best for classic cars.</p>

            <h2>Tire flat spots</h2>
            
            <p>There's a lot of hand-wringing about tire flat spots when it comes to car storage. I've never had the problem in 25 years of storing street cars two to three months at a time, but there are many formulations of tires, including for the track, that will have different results.</p>

            <div class="article-images">
                <img src="img/HowToStoreYourCar6.JPG" alt="Tire">                
                <figcaption>Do you really have to jack your wheels up off the ground to avoid flat spots on your tires? Not necessarily; try upping the tire pressure instead.</figcaption>
            </div>              
            
            <p>Many guides suggest you put your car on jack stands to relieve pressure on the bottom of the tire, but most people find that to be a huge hassle for midterm storage, and I'm not sure it's good for suspension bushings. Instead, several tire pros I know recommend just inflating the tires to the maximum pressure stated on the sidewall, which is much higher than the proper pressure for driving.</p>
            
            <p>And leave the parking brake off, unless you're storing on a grade. That will be one less thing to get stuck in place.</p>

            <h2>Interior moisture</h2>
            
            <p>Put a large desiccant inside your car to absorb any moisture that builds up before it becomes mildew. It can be hard to get rid of that musty "stored car" smell, and any mold that takes hold can also be tedious to detail away.</p>

            </div>    
            
            <p>A dehumidifer pouch or two left in your car during storage will keep the inside from smelling like mildew or developing mold in small crevices.</p>

            <h2>Yes, a car cover</h2>
            
            <p>You definitely need one of these for either indoor or outdoor storage of any significant time. A good cover isn't cheap and can be a hassle to deal with, but it will block dust, grime, UV rays, moisture and some dings and bumps. That's a lot of protection for a couple hundred dollars. I've had good luck with covers from California Car Cover and Covercraft.</p>

            <div class="article-images">
                <img src="img/HowToStoreYourCar8.JPG" alt="Car Cover">                
                <figcaption>Like folding a huge bedspread outdoors, car covers are no fun to put on and take off, but a good one is going to protect your car from dust, dirt, pollen, UV and minor impacts.</figcaption>
            </div>    
            
            <p>Choose your cover based on whether you car will be indoors or out, and if you require extra padding for bump and ding protection. And make sure you give your car a wash and wax before you cover it up -- that's like adding another cover underneath the cover.</p>
            
            <p>Whatever you do, don't improvise a car cover from a tarp or piece of plastic roll sheeting. You can't predict how those will interact with paint, retain moisture against the car, or scratch since they aren't soft materials.</p>
