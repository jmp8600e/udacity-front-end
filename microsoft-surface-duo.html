            <h1>Microsoft Surface Duo: <h2>Every spec we know and 8 that we don't</h2></h1>

            <p>Microsoft is making its first phone in years, but we don't know exactly what kind of phone it is. Here's everything we know and don't about the dual-screen device.</p>
            
            <p>The beauty of announcing a device that won't launch for a year is that you don't have to toss out the specs list or inner workings for the wolves to tear apart. 
            You can build excitement first. This is what Microsoft did last week with the Surface Duo, a dual-screen device that also happens to be the company's first phone 
            in years -- even though Microsoft says the Duo isn't actually a phone.</p>
            
            <p>We know the gist of the product -- an Android phone (which Microsoft denies is actually a phone) that essentially doubles your screen space to take on foldable phone design.
            Although we have to wait until "holiday 2020" to meet the Duo, Microsoft has certainly created a sense of hype by leaping back into the game at a time when phones that double
            the available screen space are seen as the next big thing in phone design.</p>
            
            <p>A quick flash of the Surface Duo taken from an executive's pocket, a 2-minute video and a few minutes with a non-functioning prototype were our only glimpses at the device.
            Microsoft's well-orchestrated teaser gives us only fragments of detail, leaving us to wonder if the Duo will come together as a device that could truly take on foldable phones 
            like the Galaxy Fold and upcoming foldable Motorola Razr. (Scroll to the end for all the specs we know.)</p>

                <img src="img/SurfaceDuoImage1.jpg" alt="Surface Duo">                
                <figcaption>The Surface Duo isn't exactly an open book.</figcaption>
            </div>
            
            <h2>How much will the Surface Duo cost?</h2>
            
            <p>Foldable phones aren't expected to be cheap. Samsung sells its Galaxy Fold for $1,980, and the (delayed) Huawei Mate X will go for the equivalent of $2,600.</p>

            <p>While the Surface Duo won't be a foldable phone, it achieves about the same goal by doubling up on the given screen space you have to work with for watching videos,
            reading, typing and playing games.</p>

            <p>This extra screen space is the real benefit, and the Galaxy Fold proves what a convenience it is. It's a convenience you're also expected to pay for.</p>

            <p>The logic goes that a dual-screen device like the Surface Duo (which connects two 5.6-inch screens with a hinge) is a true phone/tablet hybrid that will maximize your
            productivity and entertainment -- so prepare to pony up.</p>

            <p>I expect the Duo to sell for at least $1,500, or in the ballpark of foldable phones with similar screen area (the Duo gives you 8.3 inches versus the Galaxy Fold's 7.3-inch span).</p>
            
            <h2>Will the Surface Duo will have 5G?</h2>
            
            <p>Despite Microsoft's protestations, the Surface Duo is a phone. It makes phone calls. What we don't know is if the Duo we see in 2020 will top out at 4G data speeds or if it will be 5G-capable.</p>

            </p>The Surface Duo that Microsoft teased runs on Qualcomm's Snapdragon 855 chipset, which will work with 5G if the device also has the right modem to connect to the faster next-gen network. 
            But a year's a long time and Microsoft could also swap out Qualcomm's next chip, which is expected to support 5G right off the bat. Doing so could also bump up the price.</p>

            <p>Since every premium phone is expected to run 5G by this time next year, I'm putting my money on a 5G Surface Duo. Microsoft would struggle to compete with more mature foldable devices using 4G alone.</p>
            
            <h2>Everything we know about the Surface Duo</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A 360-degree hinge means you can fold one screen flat against the other to hold it like a note pad.</li>
                <li>You get a total of 8.3 inches of screen real estate.</li>
                <li>There's no outer screen -- you have to fully open the device to use it.</li>
                <li>Phone calls come in on the Duo's right screen.</li>
                <li>It supports the Surface Pen, which you may need to buy separately.</li>
                <li>The Surface Duo has thick screen bezels, but that might help keep you from accidentally tapping while you hold it.</li>
                <li>You can drag and drop items, like a phone number, from one screen to the other.</li>
                <li>It appears to have a digital cursor (although that could just be a visual aid in the video).</li>
            </ul>
