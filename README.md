# Project: Personal Blog Site

I have created a personal blog site called TechBlog which uses HTML/CSS. The website is created as per project rubrics. Since, I like CNET tech articles, I have taken few authors from the CNET and one article from each author. I have used CSS grid and flexbox to create proper website flows as per the requirements. The website is optimized for both desktop and mobile displays.
