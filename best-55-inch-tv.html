            <h1>Best 55-inch TVs for 2019 <h2>They're like 65-inch TVs, only smaller.</h2></h1>
            <h5>by David Katzmaier <time datetime="2019-10-21T05:25:00-0700">October 21, 2019 5:25 AM PDT</time></time></h5>
            <h5>Title: Senior Managing Editor</h5>
            <h5>Company: CNET</h4>
            <h6><b>SHORT BIO</b>: David has reviewed TVs, media streamers and home entertainment gear at CNET since 2002. He is an ISF certified, NIST trained calibrator and developed 
            CNET's TV test procedure himself. Previously David wrote reviews and features for Sound & Vision magazine and eTown.com. He is known to two people on Twitter as "The Cormac McCarthy of consumer electronics."</h6>
            
            <p>If TVs were sold on the clothing rack, 55-inch would be Medium. "Wait," you say, "my TV is 42 inches and it seems pretty big." Welcome to 2019, where TV size is cheap. The proliferation and popularity of 
            LCD TVs has led to ever-lower prices for ever-larger screens. Now you can get a perfectly decent 55-inch TV for a little over $300 -- or maybe a little under, once the Black Friday sales kick in. And on the 
            higher end of the market, just about every nice TV series has a 55-inch size. Typically it's the smallest one.</p>
            
            <p>That means this size offers more choice than any other. Let me help you decide by listing my favorites.</p>
            
            <p>The list below represents the best TVs I've reviewed in CNET's test lab, where I compare them side-by-side to see which ones are most worth buying. Here are my latest recommendations, with the following
            notes to keep in mind.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Looking for a different size? Check out: 32-inch TVs, 43-inch TVs, 65-inch TVs and 75-inch TVs.</li>
                <li>The images below are generally of 65-inch TVs since that's the size we review. But the review still applies to the 55-inch version.</li>
                <li>Don't see what you're looking for below? Here are all the TVs I've reviewed, with more coming soon.</li>

            <p>OLED TVs are the picture quality kings, but they're not cheap. The TVs' OLED displays use organic light-emitting diode technology to deliver brightness and contrast and viewing angles that no LCD TV (or QLED) 
            can match. Even in fall 2019, this OLED TV from 2018 is still the one to buy. With image quality close to the 2019 C9 (below) and a price that's hundreds less, the B8 has aged beautifully. That said, we expect the
            2019 B9 (also below) to fall in price soon, so the B8's place at the top of this list won't last forever. Read the LG OLED55B8P review.</p>

            <p>No TV I've ever tested offers this much picture quality for this little cash. The latest version of the TCL 6-Series has even better image quality than its predecessor, thanks to improved color, and its well-implemented full-array local
            dimming helps it run circles around just about any other TV at this price. As if that's not enough, the Roku TV operating system is our hands-down favorite. Read the TCL 55R625 (2019 Roku TV) review.</p>

            <p>What's that you say? You just want the best, money no object? Here you go. In my side-by-side tests the C9 is the best TV I've ever reviewed, barely beating the 2018 models like the B8 (above), but the B8 is a superior value -- almost as
            good and much less expensive. This 2019 OLED TV also has all the HDMI 2.1 future-proofing that some high-end buyers, particularly gamers, desire. Read the LG OLED55C9P review.</p>
